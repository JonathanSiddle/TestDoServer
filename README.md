# TestDoServer

This repo combines ASP.NET and an Angular application using Identity Server 4 for authentication.

This repo replaces [https://github.com/JonathanSiddle/Test-do](https://github.com/JonathanSiddle/Test-do) the Anglar application inside '/test-do' this the latest version of this application and can be used with the standard Angular CLI.

The entire project is wrapped in a solution consisting of .NET Core application and can be opend with Visual Studio or standard .NET tool.

## Still to do: 

- [x] Create TestDo Angular Application 
- [x] Create ASP.NET Core backend 
- [x] Integrate Identity Server 4
- [ ] Use single MariaDB to store data
- [ ] Finish Auth integration 
- [ ] Protect API
- [ ] Pass Auth token to Angular app
- [ ] Allow Angular App to refresh token
- [ ] More unit tests
